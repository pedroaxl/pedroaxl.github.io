Ok, I decided I should blog about the interesting things I am doing at my work. So let me introduce myself.

I am Pedro Axelrud, an entrepreneur and developer. I run a startup called Mailee.me, we develop an email marketing platform called Mailee.me(http://mailee.me).

Today my work is mixed between developing and taking care of the business. I started as a Ruby developer and at the same time I also had the sysadmin role, so naturally the DevOps role came very naturally.

The infrastructure required for sending emails is very complicated, so it made me learn a lot. For example, today we send more than 20M emails per month. Once we must be able to track all the emails sent, if you do the math considering we started more than 4 years ago, you should have noticed that our database ain't easy to maintain. Join this with all the complicated rules you must follow to send millions of emails per month without going to SPAM folder and you will understand my daily routine.

That's what I will talk about here :)
